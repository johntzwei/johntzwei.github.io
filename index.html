					Detecting whether copyright holders' works were used in LLM pretraining is poised to be an important problem. This work proposes using data watermarks to enable principled detection with only black-box model access, provided that the rightholder contributed multiple training documents and watermarked them before public release. By applying a randomly sampled data watermark, detection can be framed as hypothesis testing, which provides guarantees on the false detection rate. We study two watermarks: one that inserts random sequences, and another that randomly substitutes characters with Unicode lookalikes. We first show how three aspects of watermark design -- watermark length, number of duplications, and interference -- affect the power of the hypothesis test. Next, we study how a watermark's detection strength changes under model and dataset scaling: while increasing the dataset size decreases the strength of the watermark, watermarks remain strong if the model size also increases. Finally, we view SHA hashes as natural watermarks and show that we can robustly detect hashes from BLOOM-176B's training data, as long as they occurred at least 90 times. Together, our results point towards a promising future for data watermarks in real world use.

					The Digital Services Act, recently adopted by the EU, requires social media platforms to report the "accuracy" of their automated content moderation systems. The colloquial term is vague, or open-textured -- the literal accuracy (number of correct predictions divided by the total) is not suitable for problems with large class imbalance, and the ground truth and dataset to measure accuracy against is unspecified. Without further specification, the regulatory requirement allows for deficient reporting. In this interdisciplinary work, we operationalize "accuracy" reporting by refining legal concepts and relating them to technical implementation. We start by elucidating the legislative purpose of the Act to legally justify an interpretation of "accuracy" as precision and recall. These metrics remain informative in class imbalanced settings while also reflecting the proportional balancing of Fundamental Rights of the EU Charter. We then focus on the estimation of recall, as its naive estimation can incur extremely high annotation costs and disproportionately interfere with the platform's right to conduct business. Through a simulation study, we show that recall can be efficiently estimated using stratified sampling with trained classifiers, and provide concrete recommendations for its application. Finally, we present a case study of recall reporting for a subset of Reddit under the Act. Based on the language in the Act, we identify a number of ways recall could be reported due to underspecification. We report on one possibility using our improved estimator, and discuss the implications and need for legal clarification.

                                    In MT evaluation, pairwise comparisons are conducted to identify the better system. In conducting the comparison, the experimenter must allocate a budget to collect Direct Assessment (DA) judgments. We provide a cost effective way to spend the budget, but show that typical budget sizes often do not allow for solid comparison. Taking the perspective that the basis of solid comparison is in achieving statistical significance, we study the power (rate of achieving significance) on a large collection of pairwise DA comparisons. Due to the nature of statistical estimation, power is low for differentiating less than 1-2 DA points, and to achieve a notable increase in power requires at least 2-3x more samples. Applying variance reduction alone will not yield these gains, so we must face the reality of undetectable differences and spending increases. In this context, we propose interim testing, an “early stopping” collection procedure that yields more power per judgment collected, which adaptively focuses the budget on pairs that are borderline significant. Interim testing can achieve up to a 27% efficiency gain when spending 3x the current budget, or 18% savings at the current evaluation power.

                                    Estimating the expected output quality of generation systems is central to NLG. This paper qualifies the notion that automatic metrics are not as good as humans in estimating system-level quality. Statistically, humans are unbiased, high variance estimators, while metrics are biased, low variance estimators. We compare these estimators by their error in pairwise prediction (which generation system is better?) using the bootstrap. Measuring this error is complicated: predictions are evaluated against noisy, human predicted labels instead of the ground truth, and metric predictions fluctuate based on the test sets they were calculated on. By applying a bias-variance-noise decomposition, we adjust this error to a noise-free, infinite test set setting. Our analysis compares the adjusted error of metrics to humans and a derived, perfect segment-level annotator, both of which are unbiased estimators dependent on the number of judgments collected. In MT, we identify two settings where metrics outperform humans due to a statistical advantage in variance: when the number of human judgments used is small, and when the quality difference between compared systems is small.
